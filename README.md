<br>

PS CODE:- SIH1617

# Tools & Technologies
Backend: Node.js + Express (API server & business logic)

Optimization Engine: Python (Route optimization algorithms & data processing)

WebSocket Library: Socket.IO (real-time updates of route changes)

Database: MongoDB (stores route, vehicle, and logistics data)

Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (interactive route visualization, no frameworks)

Development Environment: VS Code (coding, debugging, version control integration)

## DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Route Rationalization Model is an AI-driven framework designed to optimize transportation and logistics routes in real time. It leverages machine learning, traffic data, and predictive analytics to dynamically adjust delivery or travel paths for maximum efficiency. By continuously analyzing factors such as traffic congestion, fuel consumption, delivery deadlines, and resource availability, the model minimizes travel time and operational costs. This approach not only improves fleet utilization and customer satisfaction but also reduces environmental impact through lower emissions, making it highly suitable for smart cities, logistics firms, and large-scale transportation networks.
